<big><b>A trivial example of gtkmvc</b></big>

The idea of this example is to demonstrate
the separation of logic and presentation
(<i>GUI</i>) layers of the application. 

The tutorial has been designed with 
an exaggerately complex structure,
as the goal is to show how <i>gtkmvc</i>
can be effectively used to design
and develop middle and large 
applications.

<b>Hope you enjoy working with 
<i>gtkmvc</i>!</b>
